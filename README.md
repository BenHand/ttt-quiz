## QUIZ!

* Clone the repo
* Fix the failing specs

Then, ponder:

* What purpose does the `tictactoe.rb` file serve?
* Why the `TicTacToe` module? How is it used?
* How much of the code is tested? Is testable?
* Are there any other bugs, or is the game playable?
* What would you write differently?
